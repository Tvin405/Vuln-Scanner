OpenVAS Vulnerability Scanner Deployment (Greenbone Community Edition)
Author: Ty Iorfino
Date: October, 2025  
Tools Used: OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager), Docker, Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS, Greenbone Community Container, GSA Web UI

Project Overview
This project documents how I deployed and configured the Greenbone Community Edition (OpenVAS) vulnerability scanner inside a Proxmox virtual machine running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.  
My goal was to perform both network-wide and credentialed scans to identify vulnerabilities across my home subnet and a specific Windows target.  
After performing these scans, I analyzed the reports, applied security patches, and verified improvements through follow-up assessments.

Tools 
- OpenVAS / GVM: Core vulnerability scanning and management engine 
- Greenbone Community Container: Containerized deployment of GVM services 
- Docker / Docker Compose: Service orchestration and management 
- Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS: Host operating system (Proxmox VM) 
- Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA): Web UI for scan configuration and reporting 
- SMB / WinRM Credentials: Authentication for Windodws target scanning

System Specifications
-Virtualization Platform: Proxmox VE 9.0.3
- Guest OS: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS 
- CPU: 4 vCores 
- Memory: 23.4 GiB 
- Storage: 60 GB qcow2 disk 
- Network Interface: VirtIO bridged via `vmbr0` 
- Bridge Configuration:  `vmbr0` for LAN (192.168.1.0/24)

Deployment Steps
1) Create Proxmox VM
-I created a new VM in Proxmox using the Ubuntu 24.04.3 Desktop ISO image.  
-I configured it with 4 virtual cores, 24 GiB of RAM, and 60 GB of storage.  
-Instead of using Proxmox helper scripts, I manually installed Ubuntu from the ISO.  
-The VMâ€™s network interface was bridged via `vmbr0`, allowing it to access my LAN.

2) Install Greenbone Community Edition
-Inside the Ubunut VM, I followed the official Greenbone Community documentation for Docker deployment:  
  (https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/)  
-Then I used the Greenbone installation scripts to deploy containers for:  
  - Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM)  
  - OpenVAS Scanner  
  - PostgreSQL database  
  - Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) Web UI  
-After installation in order to start all containers you want to run:
  -docker compose up -d
(It takes sometime for all feeds to synchronize)

3) Accessing the Greenbone GUI
- Once all containers were finished starting up I access the GUI by utilizing Ubuntus firefox browers and going to http:\\127.0.0.1:9392.
  - to find this IP I used the command: ip addr show, this showed me my ip to connect to the GUI and also allowed me to make sure the VM was on the same subnet as my devices for a proper scan.
- I then made sure that all feed status were up to date to do this go to Administration -> Feed Status, make sure all status say "up to date".

4) Creating Scan Targets
- I created tow seperate scan targets under Configuration -> Targets:
  - 1st Target: Subnet scan, scanning 192.168.1.0/24 - to discover and scan all devices on my local network.
  - 2nd Target: Single host scan, a single Windows IP address scan on my LAN (192.168.1.xxx).

5) Configuring SMB Credentials for single host scan
- For the single host Windows target, I created a set of SMB credentials named winAuth. To do this go to Configuration -> Credentials -> New Credentials.
- This let the scanner do an authenticated scan for deeper checks against the Windows system.
- I attached these credentials to the single-host target so that the scan would do authenticated checks.

6) Creating and Running Scan Tasks
- Next, I create two scan tasks in the Scans -> Tasks -> New Task.
  - 1st Task: LAN discovery using Full & Fast scan config - targeting the entire subnet using the default scanner, not authenticated.
  - 2nd Task: Windows Scan using Full & Fast scan config - targetting the single Windows host using the default scanner, with authenticated 'winAuth' credentials attached.
- Then you start the scan and monitor the process of the scan through using "docker compose up".

7) Reviewing Scan Results and Exporting Reports
- Once both scans were completed I examined the results by going to Scans -> Reports.
- I exported each report as a PDF creating a local audit record of vulnerabilities found and how to fix them.

8) Applying Patches and Re-Scanning
- Using the reports I identified all high-severity vulnerabilities on the Windows host.
- I applied Windows updates and software updates on the system and affected application then re-ran a credentialed scan.
- The second scan showed a reduction in high and medium-severity issues, showing successful remediation.

9) Final Observations
- After reviewing the final report I noticed all of the remaining high severity issues was caused by OPENSSL end of life, which I couldnt update becasue thats what python and java apps uses, aslong as these process are used locally I should be fine.
- The overall system risk score decreased significantly and there were a lot less vulnerabilities.
