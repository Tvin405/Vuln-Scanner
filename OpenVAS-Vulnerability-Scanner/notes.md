Author: Ty Iorfino
Date: September - October, 2025  
Tools Used: OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager), Docker, Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS, Greenbone Community Container, GSA Web UI

Project Overview
This project involved deploying OpenVAS (Greenbone) vulnerability scanner in a virtualized environment using Docker containers.  
The goal was to perform authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability assessments across a home lab network, including both Linux and Windows hosts.

I used official Greenbone Community Edition (GCE) containers, for both discovery scans and credentialed scans via SMB authentication.

Objectives
- Deploy OpenVAS using Docker within an Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS virtual machine.  
- Configure and update Greenbone feeds for vulnerability, SCAP, and CERT data.  
- Discover active hosts across the local subnet (192.168.1.x/24).  
- Conduct authenticated credentialed scans on a Windows target via SMB.  
- Identify vulnerabilities by severity (CVSSv3) and verify patch levels on discovered hosts.
